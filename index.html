        <h2>A bit about me</h2>
        <h3>Personal</h3>
          <p>I am a german-mexican, living in Barcelona with my wife Linda.
            My hobbies are sports, travelling, food, culture and reading.
            The best team in europe is Eintracht Frankfurt, who I avidly support.
          </p>
        <h3>Professional</h3>
          <p>Currently I work as an Associate Product Manager at Travelperk.
            I am in the payments team, making sure our customers payments go through and that we pay our suppliers accordingly.
            Previously, I worked at Monzo. A mobile only bank based in the UK.

          <h2>Follow me</h2>
          <p>Sorry, <strong>no social media</strong> for me. Only LinkedIn (which is bad enough). Ok, I also have Twitter.</p>
          <a href="https://github.com/isaquito1993" target="_blank">
            Also Github. Click on me.
          </a>
          <p>But that's not really a social media to follow someone. Here are the others:
